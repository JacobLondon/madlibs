Did you ever hear the tragedy of #ADJECTIVE #NAME the #ADJECTIVE? I thought not. It’s not a story the #NAME would tell you. It’s a #NAME legend. #ADJECTIVE #NOUN was a #ADJECTIVE Lord of the #PLACE, so powerful and so #ADJECTIVE he could use the Force to influence the #NOUN to #VERB #NOUN. He had such a knowledge of the #ADJECTIVE side that he could even keep the #NOUNS he #VERBED about from #VERBING. The #ADJECTIVE side of the Force is a #NOUN to many abilities some consider to be #ADJECTIVE. He became so powerful the only thing he was #ADJECTIVE of was losing his #NOUN, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he #VERBED his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice #VERBED him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from #NOUN, but not himself.
