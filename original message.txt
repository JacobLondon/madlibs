Collapse of the Realm

Common Knowledge 
	Etrenia, a beautiful land of forests and plains. Producing a large amount of the world's grain, the people lived with an abundance of food. The populations of the realm would grow to be the largest and wealthiest of its neighboring kingdoms. Known for its temperate climate, inland sea, and stunning mountains, Etrenia was the perfect place to live. Home to mostly humans, some dwarfs, and elves, the kingdom lived in racial harmony as each saw each other as equals. 80% of the population was human, while the rest split between the elves and dwarfs. The elves of the world could live to be up to 200 years old, and known to be quite wise and intelligent. They often came from wealth and held a few powerful and rich feifs. Often used as scouts, elves could hear far better than any other. Dwarfs, The most stout and strong stood at just an average of 5 feet tall. The dwarven mines provided the real with much of its gems and metals due to partially how well they could see in the dark. Humans, the majority, are resilient and loved. Providing the food and culture to the realm they held the bulk of power. All kings of Etrenia had and must be human. 
Etrenia, along with the rest of the world, had a population of magic users. Making up less than 10% of the population, the magic casters naturally became the leading class, the lords. Believing to all share the same bloodline from before known history, the lords get their magic from the land. A lord will sign loyalty to the land, and in return the land will grant them its power. Families have studied and taught their children from a young age how to master the local ways. 
	Etrenia is a kingdom of feudal fiefs loyal to lords and those lords loyal to a king. The kingdom has been without war with other countries for over 30 years. Known for its cavalry and archers, most foriegn kings fear the proud Etrenian army. Having spread from the south of the Etland subcontinent, Etrenia has conquered, subjugated, and integrated many fiefs and smaller kingdoms to its own. Notable houses now find peace and loyalty in this kingdom. The house of Luxen of the west, once a dynasty of kings now proudly serves under the Etrenian flag. The houses of Duchal and McCorrin, both of the east, trace their lineage to the King of Ducorin, but feud over who the rightful heir to the dead throne is. 
Etrenia, your home, has been recovering from a great civil war. 5 years ago the Duchal clan attempted to restore the old throne of the east but was defeated by King Charles IIX of the house of Andor. Failing to unite both Duchal house and McCorrin, the east never stood a chance to defeat the loyalists in a civil war. That was what the people thought until the battle of the marshes. The prince of Andor, son of King Charles IIX, rushed his elite cavalry guard to defeat Henry of Duchal house immediately, much to the king’s order to not do so. Duchal lured the prince into a valley known to be a floodplain to the locals, and unknown to the southern nobles. A few lesser nobles of the west attempted to convince the prince of the folly he was about to make and fled when he did not listen. As the rain came and turned the valley into a marsh, eastern arrows poured onto the prince's army whilst spears closed in on the sides. A small number of lords and men were able to retreat as the brave prince and his elite guard bought them time, at the cost of their lives. The equipment the Duchal clan captured from their victory would fund the war. 
Etrenia was in chaos, with the death of the only male heir and defeat of the best soldiers the army had, the economy collapsed. The king rallied a large army together and marched north east towards the castle of Martnya. The siege of Martnya would last 4 months until the outer walls were breached and the son of Henry surrendered. The assault on the walls was a bitter and bloody conflict, something the king would be desturbed by to this day. General Burns would soon take command of the army over the distraught king. Burns met Henry near the town of Pendremic. The two armies would skirmish for two days until the armies began to clash. As hundreds died Henry rose a flag, to end the bloodshed. He made a proud speech that the death of many men was not worth the title of king and returned his loyalty to the king. The king, in such a war warry state, accepted Henry back to the kingdom. General Burns advocated the execution of the trator, but the king wished not to see more death. 
Etrenia now held its 5th annual peace day, a celebration of the end of the civil war, where you, a lesser noble, arrived yesterday to celebrate.
